## HelloWorld('Print')
Haha, just kidding! Hello there! I'm just a random dude on the internet having a curiosity for software, tech related things and whatnot. I'm glad to meet you, random stranger on the internet.

## Do you have any plans?
Plans? I don't have any right now... A person can dream can't they? Heh... 

## What are you in? 
Currently I'm in the Temple City High School Aero team, Software division, where we make an autonomous AI drone fly around and go do some tasks, but you can dig deeper, as I'm not here to yap about that.

## Fun facts about me!
- I am a coin collector enthusiast  
- I love puzzles  
- I play the trumpet!  
- I am an avid and crazed Teto enjoyer  
- ...did I say I am absolutely fond of anything Teto themed?  

## What can you expect from me?
hmmm... nothing much... I started my software journey in October 2025 when I got my first laptop, so don't expect much from me :/

## what languages do I know
I'm an intermediate in Python and Scratch.... and thats about it...


Other than that, I will hopefully be seeing you around the internet! Goodbye, random stranger!
